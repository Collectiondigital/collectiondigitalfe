              I'm a Jr. Full-Stack Developer who bridges the gap between design
              and development. With a background in UI design, I understand the
              importance of aesthetics and user-centered design principles. My
              proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript & React allows me to bring
              these designs to life, creating engaging and responsive web
              applications. My career goals revolve around combining my design &
              UI skills with coding for organisations dedicated to causes close
              to my heart, including those that support animals, the
              environment, people, businesses or heritage.

            The concept for Collection Digital came out of my time living in
            London, working as a collection assistant for small museums and
            individual collectors. Most used Excel or Word to document their
            collections with separate files for images, some used a hand written
            notebook, some nothing at all.
            <br />
            <br />
            Most digital collection software is made for large museums with
            complex features and an equally large price tag. What individuals
            and small museums need is collection software that is easy to use
            with social media features included to make sharing collections with
            the public simple. I completed the design for the app in 2022, but
            had no plans to have it built or take the project any further.
            <br />
            <br />
            In July 2023, I began a training course in Full-Stack Web & App
            Development at WBS Coding School in Berlin. During the course we
            learned how to build basic web applications, making it possible for
            the Collection Digital project to go forward. For our final project
            Sonia & Kevin joined me to build the web application. I'm thankful
            for the time, effort and fun they contributed to the project and for
            the chance to see Collection Digital come to life. - Jennifer
